# Supervised Machine Learning Challenge

## Instructions

### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
1. Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
3. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

* Note that...A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.
